# Decision record

## D-001 — Standalone research boundary

**Accepted.** Oracle is unrelated to the user's other work and has no production,
trading, or orchestration dependency.

## D-002 — Interaction thesis, not ratio canon

**Accepted.** `fuel / absorption` is one candidate representation. Components,
additive forms, interactions, ratios, and log differences must be compared.

## D-003 — Parallel fuel challengers

**Accepted.** Hyperliquid-observed, internally inferred CEX, and vendor/model fuel
surfaces remain separate until independently validated.

## D-004 — Impact susceptibility terminology

**Accepted.** v0 does not claim to estimate complete effective absorption. Visible
book-walk and trailing realized-impact proxies remain separately named.

## D-005 — Separate research clocks

**Accepted.** Precondition and ignition/continuation experiments are evaluated and
reported separately.

## D-006 — Two invalidity classes

**Accepted.** Construct invalidity rejects a measurement path. Predictive invalidity
after construct validation may reject the operational thesis.

## D-007 — First-passage scope

**Accepted.** v0 uses consolidated-index +/-2% first passage at 1h and 4h, mirrored
upside/downside. A volatility-normalized twin is required but not yet specified.

## D-008 — No platform before evidence

**Accepted.** No live service, dashboard, generic runner, execution connection, or
expanded feature programme is authorized by the v0 scaffold.

## D-009 — Prior-evidence refinements

**Accepted.** Motivated by arXiv:2607.27070 and arXiv:2608.03616: taker-flow
variance compression joins M1 as the strongest prior-evidence baseline; an
armed-quadrant occupancy gate and a trailing-path confounding report are required
before interaction modelling; Hyperliquid construct validation splits book-hitting
from backstop-absorbed liquidation mass; the Binance metrics/kline interval
convention trap and the fill-log deduplication rule are binding in
`DATA_CONTRACT.md`.

## D-010 — Compute and data topology

**Accepted.** The user workstation is the canonical repository seat. The headless
data host (`dexter`) owns the immutable raw-data root (`~/oracle-data`) and heavy
data construction. Git is the only bridge; data never enters the repository.

## D-011 — Thin orchestration

**Accepted.** The lead agent holds research judgment and reviews everything;
mechanical, well-specified work is delegated to lighter Cursor-native models.
Contract documents, experiment design, and verdicts are never delegated. Details
in `AGENTS.md`.

## D-012 — Analytical store

**Accepted.** DuckDB over Parquet files, rebuildable from raw plus manifests. No
database server or hosted store in v0.

## Open decisions

- Consolidated BTC index construction.
- Raw and derived data roots.
- Point-in-time historical source selection.
- Volatility-normalized barrier estimator.
- Event-cluster definition.
- Precondition-clock impulse exclusion.
- Normalized book-walk sizing rule.
- Initial chronological split boundaries.
